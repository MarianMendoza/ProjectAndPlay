    <h2>About Project and Play</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Project and Play</i>, a photography project to encapsulate how overpowering lighting can be. What if we make it dramatic?
            To the point where you may think it's perhaps too much. As someone who is overly obsessed with colour theory,
            I've decided to show you how playful you can be with the use of coloured lighting even if it is too much! I can only be so grateful to the artistic and creative minds who have influenced the
            use of lighting. It's used everywhere! From what we see in music videos, to your favorite movies to intensify the 
            shot, or the great and overpowering and inspirational scenes that make your heart pound. Let me immerse you into the world of overpowering lighting 
            and saturated colours.

        <h3>How this project began</h3>
        <img src ="root/aboutpage/1.PNG" alt = "Shane, Evan and Jay posing for the camera in a studio."/>
        <p>
            I have always loved photography as a young child, I very much got this from my family. I did Art for the Leaving Certificate, and 
            I guess you can say my venture in photography started there. I even studied film noir to understand cinematography techniques.
            . While film noir is black and white. I thought, could the same
            be achieved with colours? And by colours, I mean <i>LOTS OF IT</i>. I found it absolutely fascinating how dramatic the grey-scale
            and saturation can exemplify the viewer's experience. Heck! I can't even describe the effect it left on me I just have to say that colour
            is just an aesthetic on it's own.

        <h3>The Impact Of Lighting</h3>

        <p>
            Lighting, is one of the most effective elements that capture atmosphere and emotions. It's one of the most powerful tools in photography
            . Lighting can be used in many different ways. It can vary from extremely harsh or natural lighting
            and it all just depends on what you want to capture. One of my biggest tips when it comes to lighting, is consider what impact
            you want to leave on the viewers. Project and Play encapsulates how just playful you can be with colours, how it adds personality to the 
            figure. How it compliments the face and the overpowering effect it applies.

        <h3>Editing Your Results</h3>
        <img src = "root/aboutpage/3.PNG" alt = "A demonstration on how to edit your photos in Photoshop."/>
        <p>I used <i>Photoshop</i> to achieve the final results. Don't panic if you don't have <i>Photoshop</i> there are many free and beginner friendly alternatives such as <i>Gimp</i>, or  <i>Paint.net</i>. You can even use
            some apps on your phone to achieve certain vibes. On my phone I tend to use <i>VSCO</i> or the default editor. Apart from that, I cannot stress how experimenting
            is the only way you can really achieve the best. I tampered with a lot of exposure, color balance, curves and vibrance in order to make the colors pop. I achieved
            some blur effect with gaussian blur, and you can even hide some of the imperfections using the heal tool in <i>Photoshop</i>. All this from experimenting. A little jump
            can take you far in your results.
