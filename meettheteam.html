            <p>Ayo, I'm Marian, I'm 18 and I am the photographer,editor and CS student studying in <i>UCC</i> who made
                this website. For my Web-Development Continuous Assessment, I decided to launch a photo-shoot project called
                <i>Project and Play</i>. I've lots of experience in editing,
                photography, graphics designing
                and directing, so I decided to take up my old hobbies for this project :)! I want to thank my friends
                who I met in UCC
                for helping me out with this project!

                How are we? My name is Rory Kirwan and I am a first-year computer science student at <i>UCC</i>.
                I'm originally from <i>Clonmel, Tipperary</i> and I have always had an interest in cinematography.
                So when Marian came to me and asked me to help with some behind the scenes filming on her photo shoot ,
                I really wanted to help.

            <p>Hey :), I'm Aoife. I'm doing Arts with Music in <i>UCC</i>. No surprise by my course choice I'm a
                musician, a trad Irish musician. I love a good ol' trad session. Apart from music
                I love a night out with friends, doing a bit of artsy DIYs, playing around with photography and a cosy
                pamper night with a movie on. I work as a barista so I also love to play around and experimenting
                with different kinds of drinks. </p>

                Hello. This is Evan. I enjoy long walks on the beach and wine tasting.
                I do not enjoy the regular passage of life. I wish for a world in which I can own a lime orchard in the
                south of France with an unnamed himbo. I do not enjoy using capital letters because I do not like
                capitalism.
                Every day I wake up furious to be labouring under the viscous chains of capitalism. I do computer
                science in <i>UCC</i> as I believe the internet can bring us closer to a proletarian revolution.

            <p>Hey, I’m Sam, I’m 5 foot 11 and a half, or so my therapist says.
                I like to read sometimes when there is time…. time, time is a funny concept.
                I’m glad time is linear, and I am glad you asked. Imagine if we weren’t limited by the dimension of
                time, what an existence we would have,
                jumping between points in time and space simultaneously maybe consciously or spontaneously. Good thing
                you agree, otherwise I would sound like a
                CS deranged student. Luckily, I dodged a bullet and am studying Mathematics rather than CS phew {^_^}.
